My Tintin++ scripts (tintin.sourceforge.net) for the Torilmud.org mud.

Everything starts with loading toril.tt

Class scripts are loaded from there.

Spelltracker.tt - tracks spell buffs, good for chanting/illus/etc.. tail -f spells.txt, resize window to fit
glance.tt - glance triggers, ggl to get group list and set up glances

Use with tintin 1.99.9, havent tested with other versions

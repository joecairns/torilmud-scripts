These tintin++ scripts are written for use on torilmud.org.  They're fairly comprehensive, but need a lot of work as they haven't been touched for a long, long time.

The current project is to fix bugs, code duplication, and use consistent syntax and whitespacing.  The next phase will be to change the file structure into an abstracted top user layer (aliases),  user variables (bags, food, travel gear, etc), and a lower level implementation of functionality (auto bashing, mapping, rescuring, etc)

The goal is to hide complexity from the user, while providing powerful features.

These scripts were originally written and compiled by https://github.com/forrestbaer to whom I give a ton of thanks.

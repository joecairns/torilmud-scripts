/*You slam your shield into an apprentice bard and she staggers in pain!

You miss a human noble with your clumsy shieldpunch!

Kisama places an enchanted khanjari dagger in the back of a human noble, resulting in some strange noises and some blood.
Kisama barely wounds a human noble with her awesome pierce.*/
